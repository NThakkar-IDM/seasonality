# seasonality
Estimating seasonality profiles and relative susceptibility from public, monthly, country-level measles time series data.

This is a repository of Python 3.8 code associated with the preprint [*Seasonality and susceptibility from measles timeseries*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02150), 2024. In the paper, we develop transmission-model-based statistical tools that can be used to estimate an empirical transmission seasonality profile and associated dynamic information on outbreak risk.

The main scripts are:
1. `Profiles.py`, which contains the regression class and makes the paper's second figure.
2. `VsTSIRProfiles.py`, which compares estimates to output from the more involved model in `tsir\`. This is the paper's third figure.
3. `VsTSIREndemicAvg.py`, which generates Figure 4 and 5a from the paper.
4. `RelativeSusceptibility.py`, which generates the paper's sixth Figure.
5. `ForecastTesting.py`, which generates each panel of the paper's final figure as the flag `_example` is modified.

Many of the outputs rely on files generated by the model in `tsir\`. Go to that directory for more information.
